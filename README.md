# piano (Android)

A small Android application project created with Kotlin and Gradle (Kotlin DSL). This repository contains the Android app module in the `app/` folder and standard Gradle configuration files at the project root.

## Quick summary

- Project: piano
- Module: `app/`
- Build system: Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
- IDE: Android Studio (recommended)

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio (recommended) or the Android SDK + command-line tools
- JDK 11 (recommended) — newer Android toolchains often use JDK 11 or newer; use the JDK version compatible with your Android Gradle Plugin.
- A connected Android device or emulator for installing/running the app

Note: The project includes a `local.properties` file (not committed) that typically points to the Android SDK. If you see SDK errors, set `sdk.dir` there or configure Android Studio to point to your SDK.

## Build & run (Windows PowerShell)

Open a PowerShell in the project root (where `gradlew.bat` is) or open the project in Android Studio.

Build debug APK:

```
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

Install debug APK on a connected device:

```
.\gradlew.bat installDebug
```

Run unit tests:

```
.\gradlew.bat test
```

Run instrumentation (connected) tests:

```
.\gradlew.bat connectedAndroidTest
```

From Android Studio: Import/open the project (select the folder containing `settings.gradle.kts`) and use the Run configuration to launch on an emulator or device.

## Project layout

- `app/` - Android application module. Contains source under `app/src/main/java`, resources under `app/src/main/res`, and module Gradle script `app/build.gradle.kts`.
- `build.gradle.kts` - Project-level Gradle Kotlin DSL build script.
- `settings.gradle.kts` - Gradle settings file.
- `gradle/` - Gradle wrapper and version management files.
- `local.properties` - (not committed) local SDK/JDK paths.

The `app/build/` directory is generated by the build and contains compiled outputs, intermediate artifacts and should not be committed.

## Common tasks & tips

- If Gradle complains about the JDK version, point Android Studio to a compatible JDK (File → Project Structure → SDK Location) or set `org.gradle.java.home` appropriately.
- If the SDK is not found, set `sdk.dir` inside `local.properties` (example: `sdk.dir=C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`).
- Use Android Studio's Device Manager to create and run emulators.

## Troubleshooting

- "SDK not found" → ensure `local.properties` contains a valid `sdk.dir` or set the ANDROID_HOME/ANDROID_SDK_ROOT env variable.
- "Unsupported Java version" → install and point to JDK 11 (or the version required by your Android Gradle Plugin).
- Build failures after dependency changes → try cleaning the project and rebuilding:

```
.\gradlew.bat clean build
```

If problems persist, open the project in Android Studio and check the Build window for detailed errors.
